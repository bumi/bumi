### Hi there 👋

I’m a Software Engineer and open web enthusiast.

Currently I focus on Bitcoin/Lightning related projects and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). 

I am interested in how open source technologies can level the global playing fields. 

Before that I’ve been working with Railslove a software consultancy which I have co-founded in 2008 and that grew out of the passion to create sustainable software for innovative web products.
